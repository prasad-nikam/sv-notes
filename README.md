# SvelteKit Notes App ðŸ“’

A simple CRUD notes app built using **SvelteKit** and **TailwindCSS**. Users can create, view, update, and delete notes by interacting with a mock API.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasad-nikam/sv-notes.git
cd sv-notes
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash

```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash

## ðŸ§  Goal

Build a simple web application using **Svelte** and **TailwindCSS** that interacts with a mock API. The app should allow users to **view**, **create**, **update** and **delete** "notes". The design is entirely up to you.

---

## ðŸ“„ Feature Requirements

1. **Display Notes**

   - On page load, fetch and display a list of notes from `GET /notes`.
   - Each note has:
     ```json
     {
     	"id": 30,
     	"title": "Water Bottle",
     	"content": "It hydrates you and keeps you healthy",
     	"createdAt": "2025-06-03T11:38:28.192Z"
     }
     ```

2. **Create Note**

   - Provide a form with `title` and `content` fields.
   - On submit, send `POST /notes` with a JSON body and update the list.

3. **Edit Note**

   - Each note should have an "Edit" button.
   - Clicking it allows the user to edit the fields inline or in a modal.
   - On save, send `PUT /api/notes/:id`.

4. **Delete Note**

   - Each note should have a "Delete" button.
   - Clicking it allows the user to delete the note.
   - On delete, send `DELETE /api/notes/:id`.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - The layout should work well on both mobile and desktop.
   - Use TailwindCSS to build a clean, readable, and responsive UI.

## ðŸš€ Optional Features (Nice to Have)

These aren't mandatory, but could be a way to showcase your abilities:

- âœ… Improve the UX feedback on async operations. E.g. show a spinner while waiting for a response and/or perform operations optimistically, reflecting changes before the response comes back.
- Implement pagination, limiting the view to 20 notes per page, or infinite scroll.
- âœ… Sorting of notes
- âœ… Implement a search box, allowing the user to filter notes by title.
- âœ… Implement a confirmation modal for deleting notes.
- âœ… Dark mode (multi theme).
